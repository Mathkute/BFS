# BFS
BFS: Breadth First Search package.
Purpose: to design and implement a general use BFS package: the current version includes a program to check that it works; the design uses an abstract class and the types are generics. 

There are two branches: master and simple: the simple one is for a design that does not use a State class but only an interface Node as inner type of BFS.
